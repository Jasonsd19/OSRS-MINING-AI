NOTE: Most of the files in here are modified from https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite so all credit to the original creator. If you wish to learn how to convert yolov4 models to tensorflow and much more follow the link.

Here I trained a neural network using yolov4. The trained weights file was then used to create a tensorflow model. I then used the tensorflow model alongside openCV and some I/O python libraries such as pyautogui to automate the mining skill in the game Old School Runescape. This was a quick project and I learned a lot and also made many mistakes, however I am pleased with how the bot turned out. All of the files I have here are configured specifically for my trained neural network, the screen_capture script can definitely be modified and used for other models as well.

The darknet files contain the weights I've trained at 1400 iterations and 3000 iterations respectively, along with the custom dataset that I trained the model on as well, and various other files such as .names and .data files.

The checkpoint folder contains the tensorflow model that is based off of the yolov4 weights I trained.

Below are some examples of the neural network:

Early tests of the network (1400 iterations), notice some iron ores are not being identified in the inventory

Another early test, the network identifies every ore rock correctly

![](examples/detection3.png)  

After much more training (3000 iterations) it correctly identifies every iron ore in the inventory and every ore rock

Here is an example of the early model's detection on a pre-recorded video
